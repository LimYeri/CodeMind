so this time uh number 1734 decodex word permutation so this one is  decodex word permutation so this one is   decodex word permutation so this one is very interesting uh  very interesting uh   very interesting uh bit manipulation problem okay so you're  bit manipulation problem okay so you're   bit manipulation problem okay so you're given like an integer  given like an integer   given like an integer array a permutation that is a  array a permutation that is a   array a permutation that is a permutation of the first  permutation of the first   permutation of the first and positive number on unpositive  and positive number on unpositive   and positive number on unpositive integers  integers   integers where n is always odd so keep in mind so  where n is always odd so keep in mind so   where n is always odd so keep in mind so n is always odd because we need this  n is always odd because we need this   n is always odd because we need this this this uh characteristic to help us  this this uh characteristic to help us   this this uh characteristic to help us solve this problem  solve this problem   solve this problem so which means that you know the  so which means that you know the   so which means that you know the permutation which means that it's like a  permutation which means that it's like a   permutation which means that it's like a 1 to n right 1 to n there's a  1 to n right 1 to n there's a   1 to n right 1 to n there's a permutation the sequence could be  permutation the sequence could be   permutation the sequence could be the order could be different and then  the order could be different and then   the order could be different and then you know it was encoded into another  you know it was encoded into another   you know it was encoded into another integer array encoded of length n minus  integer array encoded of length n minus   integer array encoded of length n minus one  one   one so the rule to encode to encode uh  so the rule to encode to encode uh   so the rule to encode to encode uh is like this so for encoded i the  is like this so for encoded i the   is like this so for encoded i the the value will be the permutation of i  the value will be the permutation of i   the value will be the permutation of i x or i uh permutation i plus one  x or i uh permutation i plus one   x or i uh permutation i plus one so for example if the permutation is is  so for example if the permutation is is   so for example if the permutation is is one three two  one three two   one three two then the encode is two because the first  then the encode is two because the first   then the encode is two because the first one is a  one is a   one is a is a one x or three and then the second  is a one x or three and then the second   is a one x or three and then the second one is a three  one is a three   one is a three x or two that's how we get this two one  x or two that's how we get this two one   x or two that's how we get this two one here  here   here and so and then you're given like the  and so and then you're given like the   and so and then you're given like the encoded array  encoded array   encoded array and you need to return you need to  and you need to return you need to   and you need to return you need to revert you need basically you need to  revert you need basically you need to   revert you need basically you need to decode this array  decode this array   decode this array to its original value and it's  to its original value and it's   to its original value and it's guaranteed that the value the answer is  guaranteed that the value the answer is   guaranteed that the value the answer is always exists in the and  always exists in the and   always exists in the and unique so so the first one we're already  unique so so the first one we're already   unique so so the first one we're already given that so we have encoded three one  given that so we have encoded three one   given that so we have encoded three one and then we are expecting to outputs one  and then we are expecting to outputs one   and then we are expecting to outputs one two three  two three   two three oh yeah this three three one so and this  oh yeah this three three one so and this   oh yeah this three three one so and this first the second one is  first the second one is   first the second one is like this so the encode is it's like  like this so the encode is it's like   like this so the encode is it's like this and we need to get the uh  this and we need to get the uh   this and we need to get the uh this value      and there's some like constraints here      cool so and  cool so and   cool so and so you know at the at the first glance  so you know at the at the first glance   so you know at the at the first glance right so we have no clue how we can  right so we have no clue how we can   right so we have no clue how we can revert  revert   revert this uh encoded basically how can we uh  this uh encoded basically how can we uh   this uh encoded basically how can we uh decode this encoded string to its  decode this encoded string to its   decode this encoded string to its original values  original values   original values so what we should do is that we should  so what we should do is that we should   so what we should do is that we should we should at least try some examples  we should at least try some examples   we should at least try some examples and let's try you know let let's try  and let's try you know let let's try   and let's try you know let let's try this let's try it  this let's try it   this let's try it for example if we have like this one we  for example if we have like this one we   for example if we have like this one we have four  have four   have four uh 2 4  uh 2 4   uh 2 4 uh 1 5      3 7 and 6.  3 7 and 6.   3 7 and 6. and let's see this is the original value  and let's see this is the original value   and let's see this is the original value and so for the encoded for the encoded  and so for the encoded for the encoded   and so for the encoded for the encoded string what's gonna  string what's gonna   string what's gonna what will what what the encoded string  what will what what the encoded string   what will what what the encoded string look like so first one is the  look like so first one is the   look like so first one is the two x or four  two x or four   two x or four second one is uh 4 xor 1  second one is uh 4 xor 1   second one is uh 4 xor 1 and then 1 x or 5  and then 1 x or 5   and then 1 x or 5 5 x or 3 and then  5 x or 3 and then   5 x or 3 and then 3 x or 7 the last one is 7  3 x or 7 the last one is 7   3 x or 7 the last one is 7 x or 6      so i think most of you know that you  so i think most of you know that you   so i think most of you know that you know  know   know if we x or two values two uh two  if we x or two values two uh two   if we x or two values two uh two that's the same values it will be zero  that's the same values it will be zero   that's the same values it will be zero right so if we x or  right so if we x or   right so if we x or uh four is four the value is zero  uh four is four the value is zero   uh four is four the value is zero so if you only look at this  so if you only look at this   so if you only look at this uh this or x words uh this value here  uh this or x words uh this value here   uh this or x words uh this value here you know  you know   you know and you can find some patterns here  and you can find some patterns here   and you can find some patterns here right so let's say you  right so let's say you   right so let's say you if we actually everything so it's going  if we actually everything so it's going   if we actually everything so it's going to be uh so this this two  to be uh so this this two   to be uh so this this two fourths will be cancelled two ones will  fourths will be cancelled two ones will   fourths will be cancelled two ones will be cancelled out there's two five  be cancelled out there's two five   be cancelled out there's two five two two three two seven and in the end  two two three two seven and in the end   two two three two seven and in the end it's actually the 2x  it's actually the 2x   it's actually the 2x x or 6.      right but this still doesn't help us to  right but this still doesn't help us to   right but this still doesn't help us to solve this problem because  solve this problem because   solve this problem because because we don't know 6 and we don't  because we don't know 6 and we don't   because we don't know 6 and we don't know 2. we still cannot get the uh  know 2. we still cannot get the uh   know 2. we still cannot get the uh the original value      so i mean let's say we have uh  so i mean let's say we have uh   so i mean let's say we have uh a x or b equals to x  a x or b equals to x   a x or b equals to x so if we want to get either a or b you  so if we want to get either a or b you   so if we want to get either a or b you know we have to know the value of a or b  know we have to know the value of a or b   know we have to know the value of a or b right so that we can get we can do the  right so that we can get we can do the   right so that we can get we can do the calculation afterwards otherwise you  calculation afterwards otherwise you   calculation afterwards otherwise you know if we don't know  know if we don't know   know if we don't know a or b there's no way we can figure out  a or b there's no way we can figure out   a or b there's no way we can figure out the at  the at   the at the value of a or b so by looking at  the value of a or b so by looking at   the value of a or b so by looking at this one you know  this one you know   this one you know it it won't help us  it it won't help us   it it won't help us to uh to calculate that  to uh to calculate that   to uh to calculate that uh so here's com here comes the tricky  uh so here's com here comes the tricky   uh so here's com here comes the tricky part you know  part you know   part you know and if you look at the uh uh this  and if you look at the uh uh this   and if you look at the uh uh this as this values right like by uh  as this values right like by uh   as this values right like by uh by some uh on one the other  by some uh on one the other   by some uh on one the other instead of a consecutive ones you will  instead of a consecutive ones you will   instead of a consecutive ones you will find a pattern  find a pattern   find a pattern so let's say if we find  so let's say if we find   so let's say if we find if we only look at the the even  if we only look at the the even   if we only look at the the even either the even element or the odd  either the even element or the odd   either the even element or the odd element  element   element so what can we find out let's say if we  so what can we find out let's say if we   so what can we find out let's say if we only took like the  only took like the   only took like the even elements we have we have two  even elements we have we have two   even elements we have we have two four right two four this is the one and  four right two four this is the one and   four right two four this is the one and then we have one  then we have one   then we have one one five and three seven      so what what numbers do we have we have  so what what numbers do we have we have   so what what numbers do we have we have we have two four one seven three uh  we have two four one seven three uh   we have two four one seven three uh three seven  three seven   three seven uh two four one five and three seven if  uh two four one five and three seven if   uh two four one five and three seven if we compare with our original  we compare with our original   we compare with our original uh array here so basically we're having  uh array here so basically we're having   uh array here so basically we're having everything  everything   everything except for the last one  except for the last one   except for the last one similarly for the for the for the odd  similarly for the for the for the odd   similarly for the for the for the odd one so if we look at the  one so if we look at the   one so if we look at the 4 1 5 3 and 7  4 1 5 3 and 7   4 1 5 3 and 7 6 similarly right we have  6 similarly right we have   6 similarly right we have we have 4 1 five three and five three  we have 4 1 five three and five three   we have 4 1 five three and five three and seven  and seven   and seven six the only thing that we don't have is  six the only thing that we don't have is   six the only thing that we don't have is two      then they give us like a strong a very  then they give us like a strong a very   then they give us like a strong a very clear hint right  clear hint right   clear hint right let's say if we take the the odd  let's say if we take the the odd   let's say if we take the the odd the odd element here right we have this  the odd element here right we have this   the odd element here right we have this one this one and this one  one this one and this one   one this one and this one and if we x or if we do a xor  and if we x or if we do a xor   and if we x or if we do a xor of this element and then we do a x work  of this element and then we do a x work   of this element and then we do a x work and then we actually another one with  and then we actually another one with   and then we actually another one with the total actual of this of this one of  the total actual of this of this one of   the total actual of this of this one of the arduino  the arduino   the arduino uh list here so what will end what we  uh list here so what will end what we   uh list here so what will end what we will have we'll have two  will have we'll have two   will have we'll have two we will get two because four and four  we will get two because four and four   we will get two because four and four will  will   will cancel out one five three  cancel out one five three   cancel out one five three uh five three seven six you know if we  uh five three seven six you know if we   uh five three seven six you know if we act for everything  act for everything   act for everything they are they will all be cancelled out  they are they will all be cancelled out   they are they will all be cancelled out except for the two  except for the two   except for the two so if we do it that way you know then we  so if we do it that way you know then we   so if we do it that way you know then we will get the first element  will get the first element   will get the first element of the uh of the original ray which is  of the uh of the original ray which is   of the uh of the original ray which is two  two   two as long as we have one element from the  as long as we have one element from the   as long as we have one element from the original  original   original uh uh array here we can just use that  uh uh array here we can just use that   uh uh array here we can just use that one to  one to   one to to deduce right to deduce the remaining  to deduce right to deduce the remaining   to deduce right to deduce the remaining numbers  numbers   numbers so how how can we do that you know okay  so how how can we do that you know okay   so how how can we do that you know okay so we know  so we know   so we know this one here right so we know this is  this one here right so we know this is   this one here right so we know this is like 2x or four we know this one let's  like 2x or four we know this one let's   like 2x or four we know this one let's say for example this one is x  say for example this one is x   say for example this one is x because that because that that's going  because that because that that's going   because that because that that's going to be the first element of the encoded  to be the first element of the encoded   to be the first element of the encoded array here and we know 2. so what what  array here and we know 2. so what what   array here and we know 2. so what what do we have we have  do we have we have   do we have we have 2 x or  2 x or   2 x or b right equals to x  b right equals to x   b right equals to x and we're looking for we're trying to  and we're looking for we're trying to   and we're looking for we're trying to calculate the b here  calculate the b here   calculate the b here and we already know 2 and x so how can  and we already know 2 and x so how can   and we already know 2 and x so how can we calculate b  we calculate b   we calculate b similarly right we can use the same      characteristics of the x word right we  characteristics of the x word right we   characteristics of the x word right we can do a  can do a   can do a xor of two on both sides so which means  xor of two on both sides so which means   xor of two on both sides so which means we're gonna do a  we're gonna do a   we're gonna do a xor uh x or two  xor uh x or two   xor uh x or two on the left side and we also do x or on  on the left side and we also do x or on   on the left side and we also do x or on the on the right side      since we have 2 and 2 so 2 and 2 will be  since we have 2 and 2 so 2 and 2 will be   since we have 2 and 2 so 2 and 2 will be cancelled out  cancelled out   cancelled out and the only thing left on the left is b  and the only thing left on the left is b   and the only thing left on the left is b so an  so an   so an x is already known so so the result will  x is already known so so the result will   x is already known so so the result will be x  be x   be x do a xor of 2 that's going to be the  do a xor of 2 that's going to be the   do a xor of 2 that's going to be the value of  value of   value of b and right so similarly if we already  b and right so similarly if we already   b and right so similarly if we already know the b  know the b   know the b here which is 4 right and we already  here which is 4 right and we already   here which is 4 right and we already know the 4x or 1 we can use the same  know the 4x or 1 we can use the same   know the 4x or 1 we can use the same formula to calculate 1  formula to calculate 1   formula to calculate 1 5 3 and so on and so forth and we can  5 3 and so on and so forth and we can   5 3 and so on and so forth and we can deduce everything  deduce everything   deduce everything from there      yeah i think that's the basic logic here  yeah i think that's the basic logic here   yeah i think that's the basic logic here and so here the reason  and so here the reason   and so here the reason the reason we need to use a art we we  the reason we need to use a art we we   the reason we need to use a art we we need to make sure that it's odd it's  need to make sure that it's odd it's   need to make sure that it's odd it's because you know  because you know   because you know let's say the n is even uh which means  let's say the n is even uh which means   let's say the n is even uh which means that uh  that uh   that uh let's say the uh the six six is not  let's say the uh the six six is not   let's say the uh the six six is not there  there   there so we have six numbers and which means  so we have six numbers and which means   so we have six numbers and which means that  that   that the last one is not there so so if we if  the last one is not there so so if we if   the last one is not there so so if we if the n is even  the n is even   the n is even then our solution will it will not work  then our solution will it will not work   then our solution will it will not work because you know  because you know   because you know if we only look at the even uh the even  if we only look at the even uh the even   if we only look at the even uh the even element we have four one uh  element we have four one uh   element we have four one uh 5 3 but so what so what's left  5 3 but so what so what's left   5 3 but so what so what's left 2 right 2 and 7. so if we use the same  2 right 2 and 7. so if we use the same   2 right 2 and 7. so if we use the same formulas  formulas   formulas so we'll end up getting the actual of 2  so we'll end up getting the actual of 2   so we'll end up getting the actual of 2 and 7 instead of the 2 itself so which  and 7 instead of the 2 itself so which   and 7 instead of the 2 itself so which will not help us solve this problem  will not help us solve this problem   will not help us solve this problem that's why the uh the n has to be even  that's why the uh the n has to be even   that's why the uh the n has to be even sorry  sorry   sorry and the n has to be odd so that we can  and the n has to be odd so that we can   and the n has to be odd so that we can use that  use that   use that uh either the odd uh items or the even  uh either the odd uh items or the even   uh either the odd uh items or the even items  items   items help us get the either the first element  help us get the either the first element   help us get the either the first element or the last element and from there  or the last element and from there   or the last element and from there we can just say use the decoded array  we can just say use the decoded array   we can just say use the decoded array plus the  plus the   plus the the known numbers to calculate  the known numbers to calculate   the known numbers to calculate the rest of the numbers  the rest of the numbers   the rest of the numbers cool so let's start coding then and  cool so let's start coding then and   cool so let's start coding then and let's say we have an intercourse      encoded so i'm using this one uh encoded  encoded so i'm using this one uh encoded   encoded so i'm using this one uh encoded to to get get n here  to to get get n here   to to get get n here so let's say we have      so first let's calculate the uh  so first let's calculate the uh   so first let's calculate the uh the xor from one to n i'll start from  the xor from one to n i'll start from   the xor from one to n i'll start from one to      uh it's going to be a length of encoded  uh it's going to be a length of encoded   uh it's going to be a length of encoded plus one because the encode is is a  plus one because the encode is is a   plus one because the encode is is a minus one so the end should be  minus one so the end should be   minus one so the end should be length of this one plus one so let's  length of this one plus one so let's   length of this one plus one so let's calculate that one first  calculate that one first   calculate that one first and      let's see i'm going to call it      x or x or one how about that so we have  x or x or one how about that so we have   x or x or one how about that so we have actual one  actual one   actual one equals starting from zero and then we do  equals starting from zero and then we do   equals starting from zero and then we do i  i   i in range of one to uh n plus one  in range of one to uh n plus one   in range of one to uh n plus one right and then we have x over one we do  right and then we have x over one we do   right and then we have x over one we do a x square  a x square   a x square of everything from i that's how we  of everything from i that's how we   of everything from i that's how we calculate  calculate   calculate the actual from 1 to n so  the actual from 1 to n so   the actual from 1 to n so and we call it x for one and then for  and we call it x for one and then for   and we call it x for one and then for the x or 2  the x or 2   the x or 2 right xor 2 we have  right xor 2 we have   right xor 2 we have also starting from zero but this time  also starting from zero but this time   also starting from zero but this time like i said we are  like i said we are   like i said we are since uh we're only considering the the  since uh we're only considering the the   since uh we're only considering the the odd index      the odd index so that we can get the  the odd index so that we can get the   the odd index so that we can get the first element so we start from one  first element so we start from one   first element so we start from one and then we uh      we end up with n minus one right and  we end up with n minus one right and   we end up with n minus one right and then the jump  then the jump   then the jump is two so we have a x or two  is two so we have a x or two   is two so we have a x or two uh this dot gonna be the encoded      i okay so that's the uh this is the  i okay so that's the uh this is the   i okay so that's the uh this is the the even word      the the odd index element  the the odd index element   the the odd index element the the total actual of that and then we  the the total actual of that and then we   the the total actual of that and then we have the  have the   have the then we can get our first element which  then we can get our first element which   then we can get our first element which is the uh  is the uh   is the uh answer.append uh x or  answer.append uh x or   answer.append uh x or one to and the x  one to and the x   one to and the x or two so so after this one we will have  or two so so after this one we will have   or two so so after this one we will have like  like   like we will have our first element uh  we will have our first element uh   we will have our first element uh calculated  calculated   calculated then from there onwards we can just uh  then from there onwards we can just uh   then from there onwards we can just uh do the rest right  do the rest right   do the rest right so we start from uh the first one  so we start from uh the first one   so we start from uh the first one we end up with a minus one and then the  we end up with a minus one and then the   we end up with a minus one and then the answer will be append  answer will be append   answer will be append dot the uh like i said right so it's  dot the uh like i said right so it's   dot the uh like i said right so it's always going to be the  always going to be the   always going to be the encoded  encoded   encoded of the encoded current element to a xor  of the encoded current element to a xor   of the encoded current element to a xor of the previously  of the previously   of the previously calculated result which is answer dot  calculated result which is answer dot   calculated result which is answer dot minus one  minus one   minus one right and in the end we simply return  right and in the end we simply return   right and in the end we simply return the answer  the answer   the answer um yeah i think that's it  um yeah i think that's it   um yeah i think that's it right so this part again right so this  right so this part again right so this   right so this part again right so this is the uh  is the uh   is the uh uh we have the current encoded one and  uh we have the current encoded one and   uh we have the current encoded one and then we do actual or of the previous one  then we do actual or of the previous one   then we do actual or of the previous one then we'll  then we'll   then we'll it will give us the next number  it will give us the next number   it will give us the next number okay so let's run the code      oh okay we haven't defined the answer  oh okay we haven't defined the answer   oh okay we haven't defined the answer yet  yet   yet so the answer will be a array here      okay accept it      all right cool yeah  all right cool yeah   all right cool yeah so i mean time and space complexities i  so i mean time and space complexities i   so i mean time and space complexities i think it's pretty straightforward right  think it's pretty straightforward right   think it's pretty straightforward right so  so   so it's only one a single for loop so it's  it's only one a single for loop so it's   it's only one a single for loop so it's a  a   a so it's like a an o of n time complexity  so it's like a an o of n time complexity   so it's like a an o of n time complexity right and space  right and space   right and space all right space i think it's probably  all right space i think it's probably   all right space i think it's probably all still off and  all still off and   all still off and since we're using like the the answer to  since we're using like the the answer to   since we're using like the the answer to store the uh  store the uh   store the uh the final result      yeah i think that's it i mean this one i  yeah i think that's it i mean this one i   yeah i think that's it i mean this one i think it's pretty interesting because  think it's pretty interesting because   think it's pretty interesting because this one requires you have like some  this one requires you have like some   this one requires you have like some uh tricky observations so that you can  uh tricky observations so that you can   uh tricky observations so that you can use the uh  use the uh   use the uh the arduino permutations from one to n  the arduino permutations from one to n   the arduino permutations from one to n then to calculate the uh  then to calculate the uh   then to calculate the uh either the first element or the second  either the first element or the second   either the first element or the second element by only picking  element by only picking   element by only picking the uh either the the even index or the  the uh either the the even index or the   the uh either the the even index or the odd  odd   odd or the odd index items and from there  or the odd index items and from there   or the odd index items and from there right  right   right as long as we have one uh known  as long as we have one uh known   as long as we have one uh known a calculate known numbers we can just  a calculate known numbers we can just   a calculate known numbers we can just use this      like a x or b  like a x or b   like a x or b equals x if a and b  equals x if a and b   equals x if a and b uh if a and x they're they're both  uh if a and x they're they're both   uh if a and x they're they're both they're both known then we can just use  they're both known then we can just use   they're both known then we can just use we can do a like uh x a uh  we can do a like uh x a uh   we can do a like uh x a uh x or a on both sides to calculate to get  x or a on both sides to calculate to get   x or a on both sides to calculate to get the value of  the value of   the value of b and that's exactly what we're doing  b and that's exactly what we're doing   b and that's exactly what we're doing here  here   here um yep

but um with that said let's get started okay so let's see the score  get started okay so let's see the score   get started okay so let's see the score of a vertices is based on problem  of a vertices is based on problem   of a vertices is based on problem um okay so you have four minus one  um okay so you have four minus one   um okay so you have four minus one a b is a plus b okay and then inside is  a b is a plus b okay and then inside is   a b is a plus b okay and then inside is times two okay  times two okay   times two okay um      i think it is just  i think it is just   i think it is just i mean this is just a stack and being  i mean this is just a stack and being   i mean this is just a stack and being careful  careful   careful um      yeah right      i think so  i think so   i think so yeah  yeah   yeah um  um   um i think that's pretty much it so let's  i think that's pretty much it so let's   i think that's pretty much it so let's let's kind of get started on that one  let's kind of get started on that one   let's kind of get started on that one then right um  then right um   then right um [Music]      how do i  how do i   how do i i think i just have to be careful i mean  i think i just have to be careful i mean   i think i just have to be careful i mean i don't think there's anything tricky  i don't think there's anything tricky   i don't think there's anything tricky about this one this is again a stack  about this one this is again a stack   about this one this is again a stack problem and when you see these kind of  problem and when you see these kind of   problem and when you see these kind of balanced parentheses type thing it's  balanced parentheses type thing it's   balanced parentheses type thing it's almost going to be always a stack  almost going to be always a stack   almost going to be always a stack problem unless there's some like funky  problem unless there's some like funky   problem unless there's some like funky uh hard problem uh though n is equal to  uh hard problem uh though n is equal to   uh hard problem uh though n is equal to 50 maybe there is  50 maybe there is   50 maybe there is um no i mean this is still gonna be a  um no i mean this is still gonna be a   um no i mean this is still gonna be a stack problem i was gonna say maybe  stack problem i was gonna say maybe   stack problem i was gonna say maybe there's some like funky dynamic  there's some like funky dynamic   there's some like funky dynamic programming you think and i'm  programming you think and i'm   programming you think and i'm i'm  i'm   i'm sure you can do something with dynamic  sure you can do something with dynamic   sure you can do something with dynamic programming and something funky but for  programming and something funky but for   programming and something funky but for this one i think you could so a stack  this one i think you could so a stack   this one i think you could so a stack should suffice as long as you're really  should suffice as long as you're really   should suffice as long as you're really um careful about it um      yeah i mean i think that that's it  yeah i mean i think that that's it   yeah i mean i think that that's it i don't i mean usually i i have  i don't i mean usually i i have   i don't i mean usually i i have a very you know like i tried to have a  a very you know like i tried to have a   a very you know like i tried to have a very precise idea before coding  very precise idea before coding   very precise idea before coding and  and   and and in this case i think it's just all  and in this case i think it's just all   and in this case i think it's just all about implementation i think ideas um  about implementation i think ideas um   about implementation i think ideas um like i have the idea but i have to kind  like i have the idea but i have to kind   like i have the idea but i have to kind of work out maybe some possible edge  of work out maybe some possible edge   of work out maybe some possible edge cases so  cases so   cases so i have to the idea i have correct or you  i have to the idea i have correct or you   i have to the idea i have correct or you know i think it's correct but it's about  know i think it's correct but it's about   know i think it's correct but it's about implementation is the rest of this  implementation is the rest of this   implementation is the rest of this problem so let's  problem so let's   problem so let's let's uh let's see how that goes um so  let's uh let's see how that goes um so   let's uh let's see how that goes um so okay  okay   okay so  so   so let's say if this is it goes to open  let's say if this is it goes to open   let's say if this is it goes to open parens right what does that mean  parens right what does that mean   parens right what does that mean um      [Music]      yeah i mean i think that's we just push  yeah i mean i think that's we just push   yeah i mean i think that's we just push on the stack maybe i mean  on the stack maybe i mean   on the stack maybe i mean maybe there's some easy quick shortcut  maybe there's some easy quick shortcut   maybe there's some easy quick shortcut way of doing this but for now i'm gonna  way of doing this but for now i'm gonna   way of doing this but for now i'm gonna always just push things on the stack and  always just push things on the stack and   always just push things on the stack and then see how it goes right like like  then see how it goes right like like   then see how it goes right like like maybe you could represent this in a more  maybe you could represent this in a more   maybe you could represent this in a more efficient way but but like i always say  efficient way but but like i always say   efficient way but but like i always say um  um   um you know efficient wrong answer is still  you know efficient wrong answer is still   you know efficient wrong answer is still a wrong answer right so get it right  a wrong answer right so get it right   a wrong answer right so get it right first and then we can optimize later  first and then we can optimize later   first and then we can optimize later don't prematurely optimize okay so then  don't prematurely optimize okay so then   don't prematurely optimize okay so then now the top one is the more interesting  now the top one is the more interesting   now the top one is the more interesting one right  one right   one right so then we obviously have to pop we can  so then we obviously have to pop we can   so then we obviously have to pop we can assume that there is a parent so then  assume that there is a parent so then   assume that there is a parent so then what happens so if      if um  if um   if um because i don't think we have to  because i don't think we have to   because i don't think we have to validate it right so it's only parents  validate it right so it's only parents   validate it right so it's only parents or  or   or balance so if stack greater than one  balance so if stack greater than one   balance so if stack greater than one is equal to  is equal to   is equal to so if this is equal to the open parents  so if this is equal to the open parents   so if this is equal to the open parents then we should replace it with one      maybe so i'm not not gonna lie oh and  maybe so i'm not not gonna lie oh and   maybe so i'm not not gonna lie oh and this is a pen that's why it looks  this is a pen that's why it looks   this is a pen that's why it looks awkward  awkward   awkward um      no whoops that's not what i meant to do  no whoops that's not what i meant to do   no whoops that's not what i meant to do i mean it's fine but okay      so else meaning that  so else meaning that   so else meaning that top of the stack is a number  top of the stack is a number   top of the stack is a number um that means that  um that means that   um that means that basically  basically   basically and i think the hard part for me is just  and i think the hard part for me is just   and i think the hard part for me is just kind of in my head trying to thank for  kind of in my head trying to thank for   kind of in my head trying to thank for all the cases and making sure that i  all the cases and making sure that i   all the cases and making sure that i don't have weird edge cases but i think  don't have weird edge cases but i think   don't have weird edge cases but i think top of the stack is a number that means  top of the stack is a number that means   top of the stack is a number that means that we have this kind of problem      but um  but um   but um but i think i'm missing a case i'm  but i think i'm missing a case i'm   but i think i'm missing a case i'm missing the case where i have let's say  missing the case where i have let's say   missing the case where i have let's say i have this right but with a      i think it's just about being careful  i think it's just about being careful   i think it's just about being careful and getting all the cases but let's say  and getting all the cases but let's say   and getting all the cases but let's say i have something like this  i have something like this   i have something like this right      then in that case  then in that case   then in that case we will have you know this pops to one  we will have you know this pops to one   we will have you know this pops to one this also pops to one  this also pops to one   this also pops to one and then now  and then now   and then now going over here  going over here   going over here what we want to do  what we want to do   what we want to do [Music]      i guess okay  i guess okay   i guess okay so i guess what we want to do is keep on  so i guess what we want to do is keep on   so i guess what we want to do is keep on adding all the numbers that are inside  adding all the numbers that are inside   adding all the numbers that are inside until we see the left paren so then i  until we see the left paren so then i   until we see the left paren so then i could rewrite this a little bit um so  could rewrite this a little bit um so   could rewrite this a little bit um so then  then   then while stack my one is not you go to  while stack my one is not you go to   while stack my one is not you go to parents  parents   parents and because it is balanced we can we  and because it is balanced we can we   and because it is balanced we can we don't have to check that the length is  don't have to check that the length is   don't have to check that the length is greater than zero because  greater than zero because   greater than zero because um it's guaranteed to be balanced right  um it's guaranteed to be balanced right   um it's guaranteed to be balanced right so yeah at the very end we pop and then  so yeah at the very end we pop and then   so yeah at the very end we pop and then we  we   we get the uh we get the answer um but  get the uh we get the answer um but   get the uh we get the answer um but let's just say  let's just say   let's just say current is equal to zero  current is equal to zero   current is equal to zero while this is not true then current we  while this is not true then current we   while this is not true then current we add  add   add the top of the stack  the top of the stack   the top of the stack and then stack that pop      and then here  and then here   and then here don't know if i need this oh no i do  don't know if i need this oh no i do   don't know if i need this oh no i do because then now it's equal to the left  because then now it's equal to the left   because then now it's equal to the left parent we pop we appen  parent we pop we appen   parent we pop we appen um  um   um this is a little bit tricky so if  this is a little bit tricky so if   this is a little bit tricky so if current is equal to zero that means that  current is equal to zero that means that   current is equal to zero that means that we we we match it directly so then we  we we we match it directly so then we   we we we match it directly so then we can do  can do   can do do one else we do stack dot append two  do one else we do stack dot append two   do one else we do stack dot append two times current because that's what they  times current because that's what they   times current because that's what they tell you two that i'm saying um      but i would also say that i'm not gonna  but i would also say that i'm not gonna   but i would also say that i'm not gonna lie this gives me not that much  lie this gives me not that much   lie this gives me not that much confidence  confidence   confidence um this gives me maybe  um this gives me maybe   um this gives me maybe like 60 confidence but in any case we do  like 60 confidence but in any case we do   like 60 confidence but in any case we do need to pop off the rest of the things  need to pop off the rest of the things   need to pop off the rest of the things so  so   so um yeah so while      while      stack or length of stack is greater than  stack or length of stack is greater than   stack or length of stack is greater than two that means you have all these kind  two that means you have all these kind   two that means you have all these kind of things right or greater than one  of things right or greater than one   of things right or greater than one sorry if you have at least two you have  sorry if you have at least two you have   sorry if you have at least two you have like these things where basically you  like these things where basically you   like these things where basically you just have like uh uh components and then  just have like uh uh components and then   just have like uh uh components and then while this is true you have a as you go  while this is true you have a as you go   while this is true you have a as you go to stack.pop and you just add them  to stack.pop and you just add them   to stack.pop and you just add them uh  uh   uh consecutively i suppose  consecutively i suppose   consecutively i suppose and that should be good unless i mess up  and that should be good unless i mess up   and that should be good unless i mess up something really bad but yeah      because then now we have one number left  because then now we have one number left   because then now we have one number left oops  oops   oops let's run it real quick i my confidence  let's run it real quick i my confidence   let's run it real quick i my confidence is probably like i don't know 80 maybe  is probably like i don't know 80 maybe   is probably like i don't know 80 maybe i'm  i'm   i'm not super confident that i got every  not super confident that i got every   not super confident that i got every case but let's you know at least make  case but let's you know at least make   case but let's you know at least make sure that we  sure that we   sure that we but this is also why we test      right      all right let's if this looks good i  all right let's if this looks good i   all right let's if this looks good i have confidence i i think i skew a  have confidence i i think i skew a   have confidence i i think i skew a little bit on adding stuff to the end so  little bit on adding stuff to the end so   little bit on adding stuff to the end so i want to  i want to   i want to actually also add something in the  actually also add something in the   actually also add something in the beginning i guess both is fine      um  um   um because basically what i'm doing here is  because basically what i'm doing here is   because basically what i'm doing here is um  um   um i'm not gonna like case analysis even  i'm not gonna like case analysis even   i'm not gonna like case analysis even though it doesn't look that way but i i  though it doesn't look that way but i i   though it doesn't look that way but i i i think in my head and maybe in the code  i think in my head and maybe in the code   i think in my head and maybe in the code a little bit i do combine a lot of cases  a little bit i do combine a lot of cases   a little bit i do combine a lot of cases in my head so which is why it kind of  in my head so which is why it kind of   in my head so which is why it kind of came out like this um  came out like this um   came out like this um but it may be a little bit cheesy that  but it may be a little bit cheesy that   but it may be a little bit cheesy that way so we'll see  way so we'll see   way so we'll see here's a min okay cool yes  here's a min okay cool yes   here's a min okay cool yes first try i actually like i said i'm not  first try i actually like i said i'm not   first try i actually like i said i'm not i wasn't that confident about the  i wasn't that confident about the   i wasn't that confident about the solution um but i guess this works then  solution um but i guess this works then   solution um but i guess this works then this is great um so each number is going  this is great um so each number is going   this is great um so each number is going to be pushed on at one push on the stack  to be pushed on at one push on the stack   to be pushed on at one push on the stack once um and  once um and   once um and and      and at the way i know it'll be only be  and at the way i know it'll be only be   and at the way i know it'll be only be popped once so this is going to be  popped once so this is going to be   popped once so this is going to be linear time because each character each  linear time because each character each   linear time because each character each pair of  pair of   pair of parentheses will only get one push and  parentheses will only get one push and   parentheses will only get one push and one pop right um roughly speaking  one pop right um roughly speaking   one pop right um roughly speaking because technically merging but um so  because technically merging but um so   because technically merging but um so it's going to be amortized kind of uh  it's going to be amortized kind of uh   it's going to be amortized kind of uh amateur each of each  amateur each of each   amateur each of each processing will be uh o one so this is  processing will be uh o one so this is   processing will be uh o one so this is going to be o of n  going to be o of n   going to be o of n total um you know it's all one advertise  total um you know it's all one advertise   total um you know it's all one advertise each i suppose is how you would say it  each i suppose is how you would say it   each i suppose is how you would say it um and this as well because if you have  um and this as well because if you have   um and this as well because if you have oops  oops   oops if you have n elements then obviously  if you have n elements then obviously   if you have n elements then obviously this is going to just pop end time so  this is going to just pop end time so   this is going to just pop end time so that's fine um and obviously it'll be  that's fine um and obviously it'll be   that's fine um and obviously it'll be linear space because that it's that's  linear space because that it's that's   linear space because that it's that's what happens when you use a stack um  what happens when you use a stack um   what happens when you use a stack um yeah um i think that's all i have for  yeah um i think that's all i have for   yeah um i think that's all i have for this one      this is a little bit tricky for sure um  this is a little bit tricky for sure um   this is a little bit tricky for sure um especially for a medium one um because  especially for a medium one um because   especially for a medium one um because you have to think for the edge cases so  you have to think for the edge cases so   you have to think for the edge cases so it's not can  it's not can   it's not can excuse me  excuse me   excuse me i don't think this is conceptually hard  i don't think this is conceptually hard   i don't think this is conceptually hard but you have to be really careful is  but you have to be really careful is   but you have to be really careful is what happens with this one so i'm  what happens with this one so i'm   what happens with this one so i'm actually surprised and happy that my  actually surprised and happy that my   actually surprised and happy that my last two attempts i got on the first try  last two attempts i got on the first try   last two attempts i got on the first try let's see what i did that those times uh  let's see what i did that those times uh   let's see what i did that those times uh okay so actually i did i i said that but  okay so actually i did i i said that but   okay so actually i did i i said that but i i guess i did pretty much just oh and  i i guess i did pretty much just

For example, the two `1`'s in `\\\"1001 \\\"` have a distance of 3.\\n\\n**Example 1:**\\n\\n**Input:** n = 22\\n**Output:** 2\\n**Explanation:** 22 in binary is  \\\"10110 \\\".\\nThe first adjacent pair of 1's is  \\\"10110 \\\" with a distance of 2.\\nThe second adjacent pair of 1's is  \\\"10110 \\\" with a distance of 1.\\nThe answer is the largest of these two distances, which is 2.\\nNote that  \\\"10110 \\\" is not a valid pair since there is a 1 separating the two 1's underlined.\\n\\n**Example 2:**\\n\\n**Input:** n = 8\\n**Output:** 0\\n**Explanation:** 8 in binary is  \\\"1000 \\\".\\nThere are not any adjacent pairs of 1's in the binary representation of 8, so we return 0.\\n\\n**Example 3:**\\n\\n**Input:** n = 5\\n**Output:** 2\\n**Explanation:** 5 in binary is  \\\"101 \\\".\\n\\n**Constraints:**\\n\\n*   `1 <= n <= 109`\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"java\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1627,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"\\n    ```java\\npublic int maxAscendingSum(int[] nums) {\\n    int maxSum = 0, currentSum = nums[0];\\n\\n    for (int i = 1; i < nums.length; ++i) {\\n        if (nums[i] > nums[i - 1]) {\\n            currentSum += nums[i];\\n        } else {\\n            maxSum = Math.max(maxSum, currentSum);\\n            currentSum = nums[i];\\n        }\\n    }\\n\\n    return Math.max(maxSum, currentSum);\\n}\\n```\\n    \\n    1.
